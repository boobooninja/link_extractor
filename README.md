# Link Extractor

This is a Ruby CLI application that extracts links from PDF data.

* Specs are run using rspec

* The application can be run from bin/parse and waits for input

## NOTES:
Given the time constraints on this challenge, I focused on clean,
easy to understand and well tested code.

I stuck to the basic requirements and test cases provided.

More time would allow for the regexp to be developed further to handle various
link types as well as adding error and invalid input handling.
